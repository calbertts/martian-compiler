# Martian Robots Compiler

## Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a custom programming language for controlling robots on a grid, 
including the creation of a grammar, a compiler that translates programs written in this language into bytecode, 
and a virtual machine (VM) that executes the bytecode. The language should allow users to define a grid, specify robot movements and rotations, 
and handle edge cases such as robots moving off the grid.

## Requirements
1. **Grammar**: Design a grammar for the programming language that includes:
    - Definition of the grid size.
    - Definition of robots with their initial positions and orientations.
    - Instructions for moving and rotating robots.
2. **Compiler**: Implement a compiler that translates the source code written in the defined programming language into bytecode according to the provided bytecode specification.
3. **Virtual Machine**: Develop a virtual machine that executes the generated bytecode and outputs the final positions and states of the robots.

## Movement Logic
The surface of Mars is modeled by a rectangular grid. Robots can move and rotate based on instructions. Each robot has a position and an orientation:

1. **Position**: Represented by a pair of integers `(x, y)` indicating grid coordinates.
2. **Orientation**: Represented by one of the four cardinal directions (`N`, `S`, `E`, `W`).

Robots follow these instructions:
- **Left (`L`)**: Turns the robot 90 degrees to the left without changing its position.
- **Right (`R`)**: Turns the robot 90 degrees to the right without changing its position.
- **Forward (`F`)**: Moves the robot one grid point forward in its current orientation without changing the orientation.

The robot's movement logic is as follows:
- **North (`N`)**: Moving forward increases the `y` coordinate by 1.
- **East (`E`)**: Moving forward increases the `x` coordinate by 1.
- **South (`S`)**: Moving forward decreases the `y` coordinate by 1.
- **West (`W`)**: Moving forward decreases the `x` coordinate by 1.

If a robot moves off the edge of the grid, it is considered lost and leaves a "scent" at the last grid position it occupied before disappearing. Future robots will ignore move commands that would cause them to move off the grid from a scented position.

### Input Example
Sample program to be compiled:

```
Square 5 3

Carlos
Move 1 1 E
RFRFRFRF

Mike
Move 3 2 N
FRRFLLFFRRFLL

Jhon
Move 0 3 W
LLFFFLFLFL
```

#### Expected Output
The expected output of the VM after executing the bytecode:

```
Carlos: 1 1 E
Mike: 3 3 N LOST
Jhon: 2 3 S
```

## Deliverables
1. **Grammar Definition**: A formal grammar (using PEG.js or similar) defining the syntax of the programming language.
2. **Compiler**: A compiler that converts source code into bytecode following the specified bytecode format.
3. **Virtual Machine**: A virtual machine that reads the bytecode and executes the instructions, outputting the final positions and states of the robots.
4. **Documentation**: Documentation explaining the grammar, the structure of the compiler, and how the VM processes the bytecode. Include instructions on how to run the compiler and VM with sample inputs.

## Bonus
- Implement inter-process communication (IPC) to trigger signals ("MOVE", "ROTATE", etc.) that can be listened to by other processes, using either named pipes (FIFOs) or stdin.
- Include error handling for invalid instructions or edge cases (e.g., moving off the grid).
- Provide a set of unit tests for the compiler and the VM to ensure correctness.

## Submission
Submit your solution as a Git repository containing:
- Source code for the grammar, compiler, and virtual machine.
- Sample programs and their corresponding bytecode.
- Documentation and instructions for running the code.
- Unit tests for both the compiler and the VM.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness: The solution correctly compiles the provided source code into bytecode and executes it to produce the expected output.
- Completeness: All required components (grammar, compiler, VM) are implemented and documented.
- Code Quality: The code is well-organized, readable, and follows best practices.
- Robustness: The solution handles edge cases and errors gracefully.
- Bonus: Additional features such as IPC and comprehensive tests are implemented.

## Bytecode Specification

#### General Structure
1. **Planet Definition**:
   - `0x01` - Indicates the start of the planet definition.
   - Two bytes follow for the width (`w`) and height (`h`) of the planet grid.

2. **Robot Instructions**:
   - Each robot's instructions are preceded by its name length and the name itself.
   - `0x80` - Indicates the end of a robot's instructions.

3. **Commands**:
   - `0x02` - Move command, followed by two bytes for `l` and `r` coordinates, and one byte for the direction.
   - `0x03` - Rotate command, followed by one or more bytes for rotations (R, L, F).

#### Direction and Rotation Encoding
- Directions:
  - `0x04` - North (`N`)
  - `0x05` - East (`E`)
  - `0x06` - South (`S`)
  - `0x07` - West (`W`)
- Rotations:
  - `0x08` - Right (`R`)
  - `0x09` - Forward (`F`)
  - `0x0A` - Left (`L`)

### Example Bytecode Generation Process

#### Step 1: Planet Definition

- **Width** and **Height** of the grid.
  - `Square 5 3` (width 5, height 3)
  
  Bytecode: `0x01 0x05 0x03`

#### Step 2: Robot Instructions

- **Robot Name**: `Carlos`
  - Length: `6`
  - Name in ASCII: `C a r l o s` -> `67 97 114 108 111 115`

  Bytecode: `0x06 0x43 0x61 0x72 0x6C 0x6F 0x73`

- **Instructions**:
  - **Move**: `Move 1 1 E`
    - `1 1 E` -> `1 1 0x05`
    
    Bytecode: `0x02 0x01 0x01 0x05`
    
  - **Rotate**: `RFRFRFRF`
    - `R F R F R F R F`
    
    Bytecode: `0x03 0x08 0x09 0x08 0x09 0x08 0x09 0x08 0x09`

  - End of Instructions
    
    Bytecode: `0x80`
